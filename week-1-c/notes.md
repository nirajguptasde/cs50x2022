# Week 1 - C

- avoid hard coding values where you can.
- infer your humane logic wherever you can to save compute power.
- const is a hint to your compiler that it should not allow changing the value of a const variable later in your code.
- or operator is || (two vertical bars or pipes)
- for the most part, you have to be explicit while writing code becuase computers are super dumb on their own.

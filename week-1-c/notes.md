# Week 1 - C

- avoid hard coding values where you can.
- infer your humane logic wherever you can to save compute power.
- const is a hint to your compiler that it should not allow changing the value of a const variable later in your code.
- or operator is || (two vertical bars or pipes)
- for the most part, you have to be explicit while writing code becuase computers are super dumb on their own.
- for char data types use single quotes
- for string use double quotes
- By default In C, unlike interpreted langauges, you have to declare your functions before you can use them.
  - For some reason, if you still want to be able to use the functions before you define them, you have to put a small note of declaration before the main function, just so the compiler knows that the function is defined down below.
  - while declraing, you must declare its return type and type of argument. Use the keyword void of both are not applicable.
